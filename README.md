Playing around with web apps
Alex Nguyen Jun 2017
## Voice POC
- Stub project for testing out couple of interesting library functionalities:
1. Transcrypt for Python - JS whilst using JS libraries
2. Testing frameworks - Mocha/Chai/PhantomJS (maybe even explore pytest?)
3. Search - Elastic search backend using python client
4. Jquery UI Autocomplete sort to scrub through results
5. Artyom.js for voice to text - search
# TODO:
1. Figure out what to store
2. Set up elastic search; make API (flask?)
